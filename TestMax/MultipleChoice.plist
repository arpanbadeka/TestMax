			<key>Question</key>
			<string>Nine gang members were indicted for the murder of a tenth gang member who had become an informant. The gang leader pleaded guilty. At the trial of the other eight, the state&apos;s evidence showed the following: The gang leader announced a party to celebrate the recent release of a gang member from jail. But the party was not what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang&apos;s criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happened to a snitch. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after all present had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The eight other gang members watched and did nothing while the informant slowly bled to death. The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder and they appealed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should the appellate court uphold the convictions? </string>
			<key>CorrectAnswer</key>
			<string>No, because mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make one an accomplice. </string>
			<key>Answers</key>
			<array>
				<string>No, because mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make one an accomplice. </string>
				<string>No, because murder is a specific intent crime, and there is insufficient evidence to show that they intended to kill. </string>
				<string>Yes, because the gang members made no effort to save the informant after he had been stabbed. </string>
				<string>Yes, because voluntary intoxication does not negate criminal responsibility. </string>

			<string>An undercover police detective told a local drug dealer that she wanted to buy cocaine, but that she needed time to raise the necessary funds. The drug dealer said that he needed time to get the cocaine. They agreed to meet again in 10 days. An hour later, without a warrant, other officers forcibly entered the drug dealer&apos;s apartment and arrested him for attempted possession of a controlled substance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the drug dealer is prosecuted in a common-law jurisdiction for attempted possession of cocaine, should he be convicted?</string>
			<key>CorrectAnswer</key>

			<key>Question</key>
			<string>A state legislature passed a statute providing that juries in criminal trials were to consist of 6 rather than 12 jurors, and providing that jury verdicts did not have to be unanimous but could be based on 5 votes out of 6 jurors. A defendant was tried for murder. Over his objection, he was tried by a jury composed of 6 jurors. The jurors found him guilty by a vote of 5 to 1 and, over the defendant&apos;s objection, the court entered a judgment of conviction, which was affirmed on appeal by the state supreme court. The defendant seeks to overturn his conviction in a habeas corpus action in federal court, claiming his constitutional rights were violated by allowing a jury verdict that was not unanimous and by allowing a jury composed of fewer than 12 members. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How is the federal court likely to rule in this action?</string>
			<key>CorrectAnswer</key>
			<string>It will set aside the conviction, because the 6-person jury verdict was not unanimous.</string>

			<string>Police officers received a tip that drug dealing was occurring at a certain ground-floor duplex apartment. They decided to stake out the apartment. The stakeout revealed that a significant number of people visited the apartment for short periods of time and then left. A man exited the apartment and started to walk briskly away. The officers grabbed the man and, when he struggled, wrestled him to the ground. They searched him and found a bag of heroin in one of his pockets. After discovering the heroin on the man, the police decided to enter the apartment. They knocked on the door, which was opened by the woman who lived there. The police asked if they could come inside, and the woman gave them permission to do so. Once inside, the officers observed several bags of heroin on the living room table. The woman is charged with possession of the heroin found on the living room table. She moves pretrial to suppress the heroin on the ground that it was obtained by virtue of an illegal search and seizure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should the woman&apos;s motion be granted? </string>
			<key>CorrectAnswer</key>
			<string>No, because the woman consented to the officers&apos; entry. </string>

			<string>A woman decided to steal a necklace that belonged to her neighbor. She knew where the neighbor kept the necklace because she had been in the neighbor&apos;s house on many occasions when the neighbor had taken off the necklace and put it away in a jewelry box in the bathroom.

			<string>A defendant was charged with manslaughter. At the preliminary hearing, the magistrate dismissed the charge on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient. The prosecutor then brought the case before a grand jury. After hearing the evidence presented by the prosecutor, the grand jury refused to return an indictment.

			<string>State troopers lawfully stopped a car driver on a turnpike for exceeding the speed limit by four miles per hour. One trooper approached the car to warn the driver to drive within the speed limit. The other trooper remained in the patrol car and ran a computer check of the car&apos;s license number. The computer check indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver&apos;s arrest for unpaid traffic tickets. The troopers then arrested the driver based on the warrant, and they proceeded to search the driver. During the search, they discovered a package of heroin in one of the driver&apos;s pockets. Later, it was learned that the driver had paid the outstanding traffic tickets 10 days earlier and that the warrant had been quashed, but the clerk of the court had failed to update the computer, which continued to list the warrant as outstanding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The driver was charged with unlawful possession of heroin. Her attorney has filed a motion to suppress the use of the heroin as evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should the motion be granted?</string>

			<string>A woman who is a computer expert decided to dedicate herself to exposing persons who trafficked in child pornography. She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her website. The file for each photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program (a program that would allow the woman to enter the computer of anyone who downloaded the photograph). A man downloaded one of those photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the man&apos;s computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photographs leading to the man&apos;s conviction. The woman entered the man&apos;s computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child pornography photographs, which she turned over to the federal agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man was charged with multiple counts of violating federal child pornography statutes. He has moved to suppress the photographs that the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that the woman&apos;s conduct in downloading photographs from the man&apos;s computer violated the interception statute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How should the court rule on the defendant&apos;s motion to suppress?</string>

			<string>After a liquor store was robbed, the police received an anonymous telephone call naming a store employee as the perpetrator of the robbery. Honestly believing that their actions were permitted by the U.S. Constitution, the police talked one of the employee&apos;s neighbors into going to the employee&apos;s home with a hidden tape recorder to engage him in a conversation about the crime. During the conversation, the employee admitted committing the robbery. The employee was charged in state court with the robbery. He moved to suppress the recording on the grounds that the method of obtaining it violated his constitutional rights under both the state and federal constitutions. Assume that a clear precedent from the state supreme court holds that the conduct of the police in making the recording violated the employee&apos;s rights under the state constitution, and that the exclusionary rule is the proper remedy for this violation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should the court grant the employee&apos;s motion? </string>

			<string>United States customs officials received an anonymous tip that heroin would be found inside a distinctively marked red package mailed from a foreign country to the United States. Pursuant to this tip, United States customs officers opened the red package and found heroin inside. They then resealed the package and left the heroin inside it. The FBI was notified and, as agents watched, the package was delivered to the address.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The FBI then secured a warrant to search the house for the package. About two hours after the package was delivered, the warrant was executed at the house. The man who opened the door was arrested, and the agents found the package, unopened, in an upstairs bedroom closet. After seizing the package, the agents looked through the rest of the house. In a footlocker in the basement, they found a machine gun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man was charged with, among other crimes, unlawful possession of the machine gun. He moved to suppress its use as evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should the court grant the motion to suppress the machine gun?</string>
			<key>CorrectAnswer</key>
			<string>Yes, because the search exceeded the authority granted by the warrant.</string>
			<key>Answers</key>
			<array>
				<string>Yes, because the search exceeded the authority granted by the warrant.</string>
				<string>Yes, because the initial search by the customs officers was without probable cause.</string>
				<string>No, because, having found the package, the agents had probable cause to believe more narcotics could be located in the house and the gun was found in a proper search for narcotics.</string>
				<string>No, because narcotics dealers are often armed and the search was justified to protect the agents.</string>

			<string>In a city, a number of armed bank robberies were committed near closing time by a masked man wearing a white hooded sweatshirt and blue sweatpants. Police saw a man wearing a white hooded sweatshirt and blue sweatpants pacing nervously outside one of the city&apos;s banks just before it closed. The police stopped the man and frisked the outer layers of his clothing for weapons, but found none. They asked the man what he was doing outside the bank and pointed out that he was wearing clothing similar to clothing worn by the perpetrator of recent robberies. After pausing for several moments, the man confessed. The police had not provided him with any Miranda warnings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After being charged with the bank robberies, the man moved to suppress his confession. The parties agreed, and the court properly found, that the police had reasonable suspicion but not probable cause at all times before the man confessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should the man&apos;s motion to suppress be granted?</string>
			<key>CorrectAnswer</key>
			<string>No, because there was neither a Fourth Amendment violation nor a Miranda violation.</string>
			<key>Answers</key>
			<array>
				<string>Yes, because the confession was the fruit of a Fourth Amendment violation, even though there was no Miranda violation.</string>
				<string>Yes, because the confession was the fruit of a Miranda violation, even though there was no Fourth Amendment violation.</string>
				<string>Yes, because the confession was the fruit of both a Fourth Amendment violation and a Miranda violation.</string>
				<string>No, because there was neither a Fourth Amendment violation nor a Miranda violation.</string>

			<string>A driver stopped at a red light in his home state. A stranger opened the passenger door, got in, and pointed a gun at the driver. The stranger then directed the driver to keep driving. They drove several miles, crossed into a neighboring state, and drove several more miles. When they reached a remote location, the stranger ordered the driver to pull over. The stranger then robbed the driver of his wallet and cash, and ordered him out of the car. The stranger drove off in the driver&apos;s car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stranger is charged with kidnapping in the neighboring state, which has adopted the Model Penal Code.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could the stranger properly be convicted of kidnapping in the neighboring state?</string>
			<key>CorrectAnswer</key>
			<string>Yes, because the driver was transported under threat of force in the neighboring state.</string>
			<key>Answers</key>
			<array>
				<string>Yes, because the driver was transported under threat of force in the neighboring state.</string>
